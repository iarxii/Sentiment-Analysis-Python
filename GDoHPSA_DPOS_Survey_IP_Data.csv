I got a 10 minutes lecture totally unnecessary all she could do was to ask me to wait in a preffered area. Keep having to return is costly and sometimes only to be told come back again.

One evening the lights were still on ata 23:30 and the staff were having a fat chat not worried of the patients who are tired and cannot sleep. I had a bad exparience.I dont know how t is now."
